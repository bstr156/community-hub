Since the BatchInbox smart contract can take a variable number of batches (called blobs) to verify them via the data precompile they will be negligible in the overall cost of a layer 2 transaction.

For the first time in the world there is now an example where the costs are dominated by only the L2 variable gas rate (15m gas target in Optimism Bedrock governed by an EIP-1559 market) whilst inheriting the full settlement layer 1 security for the rollup. This hasnâ€™t been possible for any other rollup prior to our own, nor among any of the side-chain concepts. There are advantages where accounts may leverage offchain data availability for even cheaper transactions for short-term use cases. These advantages can be unlocked through account abstraction concepts where wallets are actually smart contracts, leading to choices for users on authorization models and where data availability is used on-chain (secure, decentralized) and off-chain (slightly less secure, less costs). Our job is to scale up the settlement layer (Layer 1) while providing the maximum utility and efficiency, leveraging every bit and byte available to us in a way to prevent censorship within a modular blockchain design. We believe this design is the state-of-the-art in maximizing efficiency and therefore making things as cheap as possible by enabling rollups to not be dominated by gas fees of data markets on layer 1 and to be dominated more by gas markets for computation/state storage on layer 2. There is no sacrificing decentralization for us. We only contextualize scaling one way - security first.
