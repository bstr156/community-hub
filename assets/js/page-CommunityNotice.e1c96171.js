For the above reasons and others we do not, and cannot, do so."),o("br"),e._v("\nRollux is a work in progress.  Rollux is built on new and evolving technology. Its codebase has been audited, but it still may contain unknown bugs. In addition, the security of Rollux is currently dependent on a multisignature wallet, managed by several anonymous individuals, which can be used to maliciously upgrade core Rollux smart contracts without upgrade delays or the approval by SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation. This introduces various risks, including the loss of some or all of the assets held within the system.\nDo your own research before using or engaging with Rollux.  Be careful and always do your own due diligence before engaging with any component of Rollux, regardless of who built or implemented it. Read widely. Stay on top of updates and developments. Be curious. Don’t leave any stone unturned, and don’t assume that something is correct or will function a certain way without verifying.\nWhen you use Rollux, it is at your own risk.  This includes risks specific to Rollux (such as those described above) and the risks inherent in using any cryptographic or blockchain-based system (such as wallet and private key management, variable transaction costs and speeds, technological vulnerabilities, cryptographic attack vectors, and risks relating to digital assets). You should not use Rollux unless you have sufficient knowledge to understand and accept all the risks.\n… this includes the risk of loss of your wallet private keys and seed phrases.  You are solely responsible for securing the wallet private keys and seed phrases you use to store and transfer assets on Rollux. It is your responsibility to avoid losing them or sharing them with anyone else. Once lost, there may be nothing that can be done to recover access to your wallet or to otherwise provide you with recourse.\nWe are not, do not speak for, and cannot bind, the Rollux community.  Rollux is a collection of independent contributors to the Rollux project. SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation are separate, independent entities from the Rollux community. While we currently do work to steward the Rollux community and its mission, we do not speak for it, and cannot contractually bind it in any manner. Unless we say otherwise in writing, the individual conduct of participants in the Rollux community are not covered, or endorsed by, SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation in any way."),o("br"),e._v("\nWe do not endorse third parties or third party information.

The world changes quickly and technology at an even faster pace. We have no idea how things will turn out and our aspirations and predictions may be unreliable. Look carefully at the date of things because after that date, things might have changed (a lot).\nYou should not rely on us for any specific future work relating to Rollux.  SYSLABS and Syscoin Foundation aim to create the technical and governance foundations that allow us to decentralize our roles over time. We happily contribute to the Rollux community today, but we are also proud to pursue a world where this community does not need us in order for it to continue to thrive tomorrow.
